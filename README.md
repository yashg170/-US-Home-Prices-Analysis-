# -US-Home-Prices-Analysis-
This repository contains a data science project that analyzes the impact of various national economic indicators on US home prices. Using the S&P Case-Shiller Index as a proxy for home prices for the last 20 years, the project examines factors such as GDP per capita, median household income,subsidies,construction cost and  more to understand their influence on the housing market.

# Steps to build the Project:
  1. # Data Acquisition:
       * Retrieved the S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) website to represent home prices.
       * Compiled data on national economic factors impacting home prices, including GDP per capita, CPI, construction costs, median household income, housing subsidies, and demographic information.

  2. # Data Cleaning and Processing:
       * Processed the data by addressing missing values, converting date formats, and handling outliers to ensure accuracy
       * Conducted EDA to analyze variable distributions, identify correlations, and visualize historical trends.

  3. # Models:
       * Implemented various regression models, including Linear Regression,Random Forest Regressor and Neural Network on same dataset to figure out best model for prediction.

  4. # Training and evaluation:
       * Trained each model using tarin dataset, evaluated performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared on test dataset.

  5. # Indentifying Influential Features:
       *
